## Project Overview

This is a brief analysis of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data from 1987 to 1997, conducted in Excel. The goal is to explore how different sectors, including the computer industry, contributed to GDP during this decade. Various Excel tools, such as sorting, filtering, and pivot tables, will be used to uncover trends and insights into the economic impact of computers during this period.

## Steps

### 1. **Initial Exploration**
   - Explored two GDP tables showing contributions by category and industry.
   - Sorted the data by year and billions to identify the largest and smallest contributors for 1987, 1992, and 1997.
   - Filtered the data to focus on the beginning, middle, and end of the decade and recorded observations.

### 2. **Investigation of Trends**
   - Converted raw GDP numbers into percentages to analyze the share of GDP contributed by each category.
   - Filtered the data to focus on the most relevant categories and analyzed the changes in their contributions over the decade.
   - Wrote a summary of the trends observed in the data.

### 3. **Computers**
   - Identified and created a “Computers” category by modifying the data in the “Computers” sheet.
   - Used a pivot table to analyze how the computer industry contributed to GDP in 1987 and 1997.
   - Compared the rank of the “Computers” category between 1987 and 1997.
