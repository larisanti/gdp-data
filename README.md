## Project Overview

This project guides you through analyzing U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data from 1987 to 1997 in Excel. The goal is to explore how different sectors, including the computer industry, contributed to GDP over this decade. You'll use various Excel tools like sorting, filtering, and pivot tables to uncover trends and insights about the economic impact of computers during this time.

## Tasks Performed

### 1. **Initial Exploration**
   - Explored two GDP tables showing contributions by category and industry.
   - Sorted the data by year and billions to identify the largest and smallest contributors for 1987, 1992, and 1997.
   - Filtered the data to focus on the beginning, middle, and end of the decade and recorded observations.

### 2. **Investigation of Trends**
   - Converted raw GDP numbers into percentages to analyze the share of GDP contributed by each category.
   - Filtered the data to focus on the most relevant categories and analyzed the changes in their contributions over the decade.
   - Wrote a summary of the trends observed in the data.

### 3. **Computers**
   - Identified and created a “Computers” category by modifying the data in the “Computers” sheet.
   - Used a pivot table to analyze how the computer industry contributed to GDP in 1987 and 1997.
   - Compared the rank of the “Computers” category between 1987 and 1997.

### 4. **Final Summary**
   - Wrote a final summary that combined the observations from each stage of the analysis, focusing on the impact of computers on GDP.
   - Discussed any limitations in the data or analysis.
