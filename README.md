# GDP Data Analysis (1987-1997)

## Project Overview 

This project analyzes U.S. GDP data from 1987 to 1997 using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to examine how different sectors, including the computer industry, contributed to GDP during this decade. By using tools like sorting, filtering, and pivot tables, the analysis uncovers trends and provides insights into the economic impact of the computer industry.

## Project Steps

### 1. **Analyzing GDP Contributions**
- Reviewed two GDP datasets displaying contributions by category and industry.
- Sorted data by year and value (in billions) to identify the largest and smallest contributors for 1987, 1992, and 1997.
- Applied filters to examine trends at the beginning, middle, and end of the decade, documenting key observations.

### 2. **Tracking Sectoral Trends**
- Converted raw GDP figures into percentages to assess the relative contributions of each category.
- Focused on the most impactful categories through data filtering and analyzed their changes over the decade.
- Summarized key sectoral trends based on percentage contributions.

### 3. **Focusing on the Computer Industry**
- Created a distinct "Computers" category by restructuring the data from the “Computers” sheet.
- Leveraged pivot tables to evaluate the computer industry's GDP contributions in 1987 and 1997.
- Compared the ranking of the "Computers" category over the decade to measure its growth.
